Snippets of SQL demonstrating a number of simulated scenarios for data access, join, and aggregation, both through MySQL and R.

* _Aggregation:_ Join, count, filter following grouping
* _Avoid Subselection:_ Best practice in a certain scenario
* _CASE WHEN:_ Aggregation on cases
* _IFNULL:_ Treating NULL as zero
* _SQL in R:_ Calling SQL from R; substring query
* _UNION ALL:_ Appending a row of total count
